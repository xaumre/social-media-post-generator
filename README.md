# Phosphor Vibe Terminal

Social media post generator with vintage terminal UI.


Feel like you are missing out on the ability to post to social media with your trusty IBM 5250 terminal? Fear not for now you can instantly generate social media posts for Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn and Instagram using Vibe Post - the AI social media generator for vintage machines. Feel completely at home with the familiar interface, yet experience the power of AI behind the scenes as it auto generates vibe posts based on your own inspirational quotes, or if you prefer, quotes generated by AI based on real-time trending topics. Experience the familiar jitter of a CRT terminal while you admire the short form and long form content, complete with hashtags and nostalgic ASCII art generated by the latest Google Gemini-2.5 Flash model. The application automatically adapts the tone of the content for each platform and it's audience - for example professional for LinkedIn, concise for X (Twitter) and friendly for Facebook. Take a quick trip down the glowing phosphors lane with this app

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your LLM API key to `.env`:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

4. Build CSS and run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will work without an API key (using mock data), but for AI-generated posts you need a valid API key.

For production builds, the CSS is automatically built and minified.
